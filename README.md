# To-do List
This allows the users to add their tasks of the day.
<br><br>
### Features
- Allow users to make edits to their existing tasks.
- Tasks can be deleted or editted according to the user's needs.
- Depending on how the users choose to interact with the app, the app will have a pop-up alert that says either of the following below: <br><br>
  > "Task cannot be empty!" <br>
  > "Please enter a task!" <br>
  > "Are you sure you want to delete this task?" <br>
  - Respectively, if a user chooses to edit a task and decided to save it as empty, the alert will happen. While if a user chooses to add a new task without any inputs, a different alert will happen. And if a user chooses to delete a task, an alert will pop-up to ask if the user is sure to delete that tas.
- Has a checkbox that creates a ~~strikethrough~~ on that task marking as a completed task.
